# Craft Commerce Product Bundles
## Plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) with [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce)

Combine multiple products into a purchasable bundle to sell these for a special price. 
Thanks to the inspiration coming from the existing [Commerce Bundles](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce-bundles) plugin, this plugin allows you to create bundles from products and not just their variants.
Users can now order bundles and choose their desired variant, eg. shirt size M with trousers size L.

## Requirements

This plugin requires:
* Craft CMS 4 or later
* Craft Commerce 4.1 or later

## Installation

This plugin can either be installed through the Plugin Store or using Composer.

### Twig example

The plugin is designed to promote product bundles from within the product detail page.
When viewing product A, the user may be encouraged in buying a bundle containing product A and product B.
The Twig example below illustrates how to render bundles in a product detail page:

![Twig example](https://github.com/onyourmarks-agency/craft-commerce-product-bundles/blob/master/resources/screenshot-twig.png?raw=true)

```
{# templates/shop/products/_entry.html #}

{% set productBundles = craft.commerceProductBundles.getProductBundles(product) %}
{% if productBundles|length %}
    <h3>Bundle tips</h3>
    {% for productBundle in productBundles %}
        <form method="POST">
            {{ csrfInput() }}
            {{ redirectInput('shop/cart') }}
            {{ hiddenInput('action', 'commerce/cart/update-cart') }}
            {{ hiddenInput('qty', 1) }}
            {{ hiddenInput('purchasableId', productBundle.id) }}
    
            <h4>{{ productBundle.title }}</h4>
    
            {% for product in productBundle.getProducts() %}
                <h5>{{ product.title }}</h5>

                {% if product.variants|length > 1 %}
                    <select name="options[productBundleProductsVariantIds][]">
                        {% for purchasable in product.variants %}
                            <option value="{{ purchasable.id }}">{{ purchasable.description }}</option>
                        {% endfor %}
                    </select>
                {% else %}
                    {{ hiddenInput('options[productBundleProductsVariantIds][]', product.variants[0].id) }}
                {% endif %}

                {% if not loop.last %}
                    <span>+</span>
                {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}

            {{ productBundle.price|commerceCurrency(cart.currency) }}
            <input type="submit">Add to cart</button>
        </form>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

Make sure to disable product variants if they are out of stock.

### Field type

Since 1.0.3 there is also a custom field type available to add product bundles directly into your content.
